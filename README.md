# Make A Move

This is a application where users who need to move to a new apartment or just move furniture into their current apartment can find other users (movers) to help them move. This is a great way to create a community, say goodbye to old neighbors and welcome new neighbors.

Movers:

Sign up as a mover with current information and find users on a local map within a 30 miles radius who need to move. The incentives to help someone move could be cash, reward points, giveaways, or just to help a person in need. After the moving event is over, the owner of the moving event( the person who moved) can reward all the movers points based on the degree of difficulty.
